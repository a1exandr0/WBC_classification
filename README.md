# WBC_classification

In this project I've tested different CNN techniques on [this](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hrezatofighi/Data/Leukocyte%20Data.htm) white blood cell images dataset.

## Structure

- Project summary could be found in [Summary]() jupyter notebook.

- Preprocessed Dataset could be found [here]().

- InceptionResNetV2 [notebook]() and [folder]().

- InceptionV4 [notebook]() and [folder]().

- Some failed attempts and unfinished stuff could be found [here]().

# WBC_classification

In this project I've tested different CNN techniques and models on [this](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hrezatofighi/Data/Leukocyte%20Data.htm) white blood cell images dataset.
## Note
Skip results whre featurewise norm was used, there was an error in code.

## Structure

- Project summary could be found in [Summary](https://github.com/a1exandr0/WBC_classification/blob/master/Summary.ipynb) jupyter notebook.

- Preprocessed Dataset could be found [here](https://github.com/a1exandr0/WBC_classification/tree/master/SelfCutData).

- .py models that were used are stored [here](https://github.com/a1exandr0/WBC_classification/tree/master/Models).

- InceptionResNetV2 [notebook](https://github.com/a1exandr0/WBC_classification/blob/master/InceptionResNetV2_jupyter/InceptionResNetV2.ipynb) and [folder](https://github.com/a1exandr0/WBC_classification/tree/master/InceptionResNetV2_jupyter).

- InceptionV4 [notebook](https://github.com/a1exandr0/WBC_classification/blob/master/InceptionV4_jupyter/InceptionV4.ipynb) and [folder](https://github.com/a1exandr0/WBC_classification/tree/master/InceptionV4_jupyter).

- Some failed attempts and unfinished stuff could be found [here](https://github.com/a1exandr0/WBC_classification/tree/master/sandbox).

## Note
I had to remove pretrained weights from repo cause of their size
